BATTLESHIP
by Grant Biesterfeldt
A quick demonstration of my python skills. You may need to download the files in a single folder in order for it to work properly. Run main.py to begin, and play the game in the console.

Possible improvements:
looping game and scoring system
improved CPU player(currently picks squares randomly)
